			<span class="large">L</span>isa and <span class="large">K</span>yle met while working at the same part-time job at AMC Theatres in 
			Kanata. Lisa and Kyle’s romance began on Valentine’s Day in 2007.  They were both 
			working that night because neither of them had a date for Valentine’s Day. After 
			some innocent flirtation behind the guest service desk, Lisa mooched off Kyle for 
			a ride home in a stormy blizzard. Kyle, being the gentlemen that he is, gave Lisa 
			a ride back to her house after their shift. Because Kyle didn’t believe in snow 
			tires then, he ended up spinning out into on coming traffic. Luckily no one was 
			hurt, but Lisa’s Mom, Mary made Lisa promise she would never accept a ride home 
			again from “that boy.” Unfortunately for Mom’s nerves, Lisa and Kyle went on 
			their first date together on February 26th, 2007. After going for coffee at 
			Lisa’s favourite Kanata hang-out, Zavida’s and spilling the beans that she had 
			seen Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring over 27 times, she and Kyle 
			saw the most boring movie they had ever seen: Breach. During the movie, Kyle 
			contemplated doing the old fake yawn to put his arm around Lisa, but because 
			Lisa is a classy broad, she didn’t accept any advances from Kyle. So poor Kyle 
			walked away emptied handed without a kiss on the first date. But, after the 
			second date of snow tubing and dinner at Jack Astor’s, Lisa couldn’t resist 
			Kyle’s charms and good looks and they had their first kiss that evening!
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			And the rest is history! After going to Lisa’s prom together, attending 
			Carleton’s Commerce program together for 5 years, and countless memories with 
			friends and family, Lisa and Kyle are as happy a couple as ever! Over the years 
			Lisa and Kyle’s love for each other grew deeper and 1,378 days after their first 
			date, Lisa and Kyle got engaged.

			Lisa and Kyle decided to take a weekend trip to Kingston after Kyle had his 
			wisdom teeth out a couple days earlier.  Kyle’s Dad, Steven, was posted to 
			Kingston during the week, so he had a fully furnished apartment there, which was 
			at our disposal during the weekends. After a fun day of shopping, Lisa and Kyle 
			went back to the apartment for the evening. Lisa found it odd that Kyle wouldn’t 
			let her go into the apartment immediately. Unbeknownst to Lisa, Steven had 
			strategically set-up the apartment as a romantic oasis at Kyle’s request before 
			he left to go home to Ottawa that weekend. Kyle went in to add some last minute 
			touches to the set-up and finally lead Lisa into the apartment. As Lisa walked 
			in, there was a pathway of roses, candles, and love poems guiding her throughout 
			the apartment. Lisa was touched at the beautiful sentiment of each poem. As Lisa 
			weaved her way through the apartment, she finally reached the last poem in the 
			centre of a rose petal heart in the middle of the bed. The poem read:
		</p>
		<p class="quote" style="text-align:center">
			One look, One smile, One touch, One embrace, One kiss, One love, 
			<br />
			Two people, Two minds, Two souls, Two destinies, 
			<br />
			One road, One journey, One ending, 
			<br />
			Together.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			<span class="large">A</span>s Lisa turned around to embrace Kyle, she found him on one-knee holding a 
			beautiful ring in his hand. He asked Lisa to spend the rest of her life with him. 
			Well obviously she accepted! That evening Lisa and Kyle enjoyed a meal of Kraft 
			Dinner (it was all Kyle could eat because of his wisdom teeth) after letting 
			their friends and family know the wonderful news!
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			But that is not to say that Lisa and Kyle haven’t had their fair share of 
			problems. However, thanks to the support from their parents, siblings, and close 
			friends, together they have always been able to work through their differences 
			and become stronger and closer because of it. As Kyle’s father, Steven would say:
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			“A relationship is like two pieces of wood being glued together. At first, the 
			wood does not seem to be attached and can easily be separated. As time goes on, 
			this glue begins to dry and the bond between the two pieces of wood become 
			stronger and harder and harder to separate. Eventually the glue will dry to such 
			a point that the wood pieces are inseparable as the bond is just too strong to 
			break.” 
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			<span class="large">L</span>isa and <span class="large">K</span>yle’s glue has dried over time and is now stronger than ever, and are 
			excited to go through life together as one.
